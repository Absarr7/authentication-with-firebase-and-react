# Authentication with React and Firebase

I built this project to learn firebase with ReactJS. 

This project lets the user to signup with their Email and Password, verify their email address, and then get directed to the "/" Page again.
When the user ain't signedup, The "/" page will ask you to first create an account or Login to continue. After you're signedin, the "/" Page will show the credentials of the user signedin.

I may add more functionalities soon.
